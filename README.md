# AqilAcademy projects(RPG, Clyde)

This is a versatile bot project that can host almost any amounts of Discord bots on top of many other APIs and a robust command storage interface. Planning to host some games and have a ton of fun stuff, while making a service to let anyone make a bot, free. Goal is to also have some optional premium features that help us pay ourselves for this effort.
